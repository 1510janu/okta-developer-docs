## 2. Review Okta’s SCIM Docs and Prepare Your App

The first step is to build a compliant SCIM server. Even if you already support SCIM, it is important that you review Okta’s SCIM docs to understand the specifics of Okta’s support for the SCIM standard:

* [Understanding User Provisioning in Okta](/docs/concepts/scim/#understanding-user-provisioning-in-okta/)
* [Required SCIM Server Capabilities](/docs/concepts/scim/#required-scim-server-capabilities)
* [SCIM Features Not Implemented by Okta](/docs/concepts/scim/#scim-features-not-implemented-by-okta)
