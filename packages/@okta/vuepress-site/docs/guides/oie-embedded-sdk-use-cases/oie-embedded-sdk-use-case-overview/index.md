### Start with a use case

Using the sample app as your guide, walk through each of the use cases in
this section to build your own app with the SDK. Each use case describes
the steps required to integrate your app with the SDK.

> **Note:** The code samples for each sample are based primarly off the
sample app provided with the SDK.

The use cases are purposely ordered so you can test each one as you gradually
move on to more complex scenarios.
