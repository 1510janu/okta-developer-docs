Okta provides two embedded identity solutions.

1. **Embedded SDK**: A highly customizable solution that
   provides native language support for a variety of identity
   use cases.
2. **Embedded Widget + SDK**: A quick and easy to set up solution that
   moves most of the the heavy lifting to Okta. Although the amount
   of code that you need to write is small, many of the most advanced
   identity use cases (for example, social sign in, multifactor authentication)
   is supported out of the box.
