title: Ongoing Marketing Opportunities
---

After your initial launch, there are periodic activities that help promote your app.

* Joint Customer Case Study

  Ask a joint customer - maybe the one who tested your integration - if they'd be willing to share their experience using your app with Okta.
  We can highlight [a great success story on the Okta blog](https://www.okta.com/blog/2016/12/afge-employees-and-members-seamlessly-access-their-applications-and-benefits-with-okta/) or even create [a customer journey video](https://www.okta.com/customers/).
  To discuss, email Partner Marketing at <partnerdg@okta.com>.

* Exhibit at Oktane

  [Oktane](https://www.okta.com/oktane17/) is the industry's leading identity conference and a great way to showcase your app to over 2000+ IT pros, cloud experts and developers.

* Testimonial video

  Consider sharing your integration story with our partner community via [a testimonial video](https://www.okta.com/partners/partner-testimonials/).
