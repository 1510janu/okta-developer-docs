You should now understand how to include custom claims in an ID token or an access token and how to include certain app-specific information in a token claim.

Next, take a look at to create a Groups claim for an OpenID Connect client application, create a static whitelist when you need to set group whitelists on a per-application basis, and use Okta Expression Language Group Functions with dynamic whitelists:

* [Customize tokens with a Groups claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-groups-claim/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a static whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-static/)
