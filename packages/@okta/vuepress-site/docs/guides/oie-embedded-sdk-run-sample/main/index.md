Once you have
[created and setup your Okta org](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/)
and
[downloaded and setup the SDK configurations](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/), the next step is to test the SDK sample app.

<StackSelector snippet="testapp" noSelector />

## Start working with the use cases

Now that you have successfully ran the sample app, the next step is to build out your
own integration using the sample app as your guide. See
[Start with a use case overview](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-overview/) to explore the available use cases available with
the SDK.
