After you fill in your SAML Identity Provider's settings, save the Identity Provider in Okta and note the value at the end of the Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL). The string after the last slash is the Identity Provider's `id` value. For example, if your ACS URL is `https://{yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/0adb8rlfooi5Atqv60h7`, then your Okta Identity Provider's `id` is `0adb8rlfooi5Atqv60h7`.
