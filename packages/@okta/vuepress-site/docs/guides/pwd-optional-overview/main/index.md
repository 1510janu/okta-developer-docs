title: Password optional overview

## Overview

Most hacking-related breaches today involve weak or stolen passwords and credential security theft. Passwords are a security vulnerability because they can be easily stolen and are prone to phishing attacks. They're also not convenient because they need to be securely stored and managed by users and IT departments.

Ditch the password for a passwordless sign-in experience. Give your users the ability instead to authenticate with a fingerprint, YubiKey, email, phone, or another authenticator. Depending on the authenticator, they can be more secure – it's harder to steal a fingerprint than a password – and more convenient since users no longer have to memorize and manage their passwords.
