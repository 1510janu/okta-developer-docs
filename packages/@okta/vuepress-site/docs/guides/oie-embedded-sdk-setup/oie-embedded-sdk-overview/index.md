This document describes how to integrate user sign in, self-registration, and
other features of an identity solution into your app using Okta’s IDX SDK.
All the code samples come from the SDK’s sample application that is provided with the IDX SDK.

### Why you would want to use IDX SDK

Several reasons why you would choose the IDX SDK include:

1. Customized user experience
1. Branding requirements

For a full list of reasons and a complete overview of the different deployment
models see
[Federated Authentication Vs Direct Authentication](/docs/concepts/hosted-vs-embedded/#okta-hosted-vs-customer-hosted).

### The IDX SDK flow

The IDX SDK allows you to integrate a fully customizable identity solution
within your application. The SDK is integrated within your application and
provides a native language interface for user sign in and other features of
the Okta identity solution.  The SDK in turn accesses the Okta platform using
a REST interface. The flow is summarized below:
