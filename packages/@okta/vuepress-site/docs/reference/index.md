Details on parameters, requests, and responses for Okta's API endpoints.



## Core Okta APIs
The Core Okta API is the primary way that apps and services interact with Okta. You can use it to implement basic auth functions such as signing in your users and programmatically managing your Okta objects.

## Inline Hooks 

Inline Hooks allow you to integrate custom functionality into specific Okta process flows. 
For example, you can migrate users from another data store and keep the userâ€™s current password with a [Password Inline Hook](/docs/reference/password-hook/).
