After you save the Identity Provider in Okta, note the value at the end of the **Assertion Consumer Service URL** (ACS URL). The string after the last slash is the Identity Provider's `id` value. For example, if your ACS URL is `https://{yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/0adb8rlfooi5Atqv60h7`, then your Okta Identity Provider's `id` is `0adb8rlfooi5Atqv60h7`.
