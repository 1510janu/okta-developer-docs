The Okta Sign-In Widget is a JavaScript library that gives you a fully-featured and customizable sign-in experience that can be used to authenticate users on any website. How you customize the Widget depends on whether Okta is hosting the widget or you are hosting the Widget (also called embedding the Widget into your App).

* Self-hosted Sign-in Widget: After you have [installed the Okta Sign-In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget#getting-started) into your project and configured the authentication scenarios that you want to support, you then want to customize. You can apply customizations to match your branding using CSS and JavaScript. See [Styling the self-hosted Sign-In Widget](#styling-the-self-hosted-sign-in-widget).

* Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget: Okta hosts the sign-in page for your applications that appears when your applications redirect to Okta to sign users in. You can customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page using easy controls or an embedded HTML editor that is provided. Access the **Custom Sign-In Page** in the Developer Console by selecting **Customizetion** and then **Signin Page**. See [Styling the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget](#styling-the-Okta-hosted-sign-in-widget).
