You should now understand how to add an external identity provider and have successfully <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp">added</GuideLink> and <GuideLink link="../use-idp-to-sign-in">tested the authorization URL</GuideLink> with the external Identity provider. If you got stuck, post a question in our [Developer Forums](https://devforum.okta.com).

To add another Identity Provider, if you have already created an app at the Identity Provider, start by <GuideLink link="../configure-idp-in-okta">configuring the Identity Provider in Okta</GuideLink>. Otherwise, start with <GuideLink link="../create-an-app-at-idp/">creating an app at the Identity Provider</GuideLink>.

> Note: You don't need to <GuideLink link="../register-app-in-okta">register another app in Okta</GuideLink>.
