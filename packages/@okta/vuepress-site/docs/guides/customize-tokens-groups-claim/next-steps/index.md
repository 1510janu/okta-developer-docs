You should now understand how to add a Groups claim to ID tokens for any combination of App Groups and User Groups.

Next, take a look at how to include custom claims in an ID token or an access token, include certain app-specific information in a token claim, and create a dynamic or static whitelist when you need to set group whitelists on a per-application basis:

* [Add a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/add-custom-claim/)
* [Include App-specific information in a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/create-app-profile-attribute/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a static whitelist](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-static/)
