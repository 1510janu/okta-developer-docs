In order to configure CORS in Go, you can set some headers on your Response in the route handler:

```go
func RouteHandler(c *gin.Context) {
  c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")

  // do rest of your handler here
}
```

You can also do this with the [gin-cors](https://github.com/itsjamie/gin-cors) middleware. We recommend this for a more practical approach.

1. First of all, add `gin-cors` as a dependency to xxxxxxxxx (FILL IN):

```go
xxx
```

2. Add the following code to xxxxxx (FILL IN):

```go
// Apply the middleware to the router (works with groups too)
router.Use(cors.Middleware(cors.Config{
    Origins:         "*",
    Methods:         "GET, PUT, POST, DELETE",
    RequestHeaders:  "Origin, Authorization, Content-Type",
    ExposedHeaders:  "",
    MaxAge:          50 * time.Second,
    Credentials:     true,
    ValidateHeaders: false,
}))
```
