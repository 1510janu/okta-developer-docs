title: The Big Picture
---
Okta can host a sign-in page for your applications. It appears when your applications redirect to Okta to sign users in. This page can be customized to fit your brand or your application's look and feel, so that your user experience is consistent and seamless. You can customize the Okta-hosted sign-in page using form controls and an embedded HTML editor that are provided on the **Custom Signin** tab of the **Customization** page.

When used together with the custom URL domain (required) and the custom Okta-hosted error page, this feature offers a fully customized end user sign-in experience hosted by Okta.

> Note: The Okta-hosted sign-in page uses the Okta Sign-In Widget component. This guide is about customizing the sign-in page itself, for example, adding custom HTML and CSS. See [Customize and Style the Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/) for more information on customizations for the Sign-In Widget.
