title: Create your Okta organization
---

You built an awesome app and you want to add user authentication to it. Let’s get you set up and working with Okta.

To start, you're going to need an org. An org is a private data space&mdash;provided by Okta&mdash;that holds all the resources that you create to handle user authentication. See [Okta organizations](/docs/concepts/okta-organizations).

You can sign up for an Okta developer edition org for free, which allows for up to 100 monthly active users (MAU). Later, when you need more capacity, you can upgrade to a paid org.

#### Create your org

#### Next steps

Your org is now created and usable. There's a survey you’re prompted to fill out about your role, aims, and software stack, which can help us support you.

A wizard launches to help you through basic setup for a few commons scenarios. You can choose to exit the wizard by clicking **Dashboard**. (In the next sections of this QuickStart, we won’t use the wizard, but rather the regular Dashboard menus that can be used on an ongoing basis.)

You now have an org. You can create additional orgs at any time, and it's often useful to do so to support separate development environments.
