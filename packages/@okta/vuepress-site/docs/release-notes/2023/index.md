#### Password history policy enforced in strict mode is GA in Production

When an admin [updates passwords](/docs/reference/api/users/#update-user) and sets the `strict` parameter to `true`, the [password history policy](/docs/reference/api/policy/#age-object) is now enforced.<!-- OKTA-563910-->

#### Revoke user sessions is GA in Production

You can end all Okta sessions for a user when resetting their password. All sessions of the specified user are revoked except for the current session. This option protects the user account from unauthorized access. See the `revokeSession` parameter in the [Users API](/docs/reference/api/users/#change-password). <!-- OKTA-542646-->

#### PBKDF2 Hashing Algorithm support is GA in Production

Okta now supports Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) for hashing imported user passwords. This hashing algorithm is used to reduce the vulnerabilities of brute-force attacks. <!-- OKTA-563886-->

#### Optional consent for OAuth 2.0 scopes is EA in Preview

OAuth 2.0 Optional Consent provides an optional property that enables a user to opt in or out of an app's requested OAuth scopes. When optional is set to true for a scope, the user can skip consent for that scope. See Request user consent. <!-- OKTA-563884-->

#### Bugs fixed in 2023.01.0

* During the authenticator enrollment flow using the `/authorize` endpoint, users couldn't enroll in the Custom APP authenticator. (OKTA-558352)

* The Log Streaming API returned the Splunk Cloud `token` property in the response body. (OKTA-437264)
