## Start with a use case

Using the sample app as your guide, walk through each of the use cases in
this section to build your own app with the SDK. Each use case describes
the steps required to integrate your app with the SDK.

The supported use cases are as follows:

1. [Basic user sign in](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-in/)
1. [User sign out](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-basic-sign-out/)
1. [Sign in with Facebook](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-soc-idp/)
1. [User password recovery](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-pwd-recovery-mfa/)
1. [Self registration](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-self-reg/)
1. [Sign in with password and email factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-email/)
1. [Sign in with password and phone factor](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-sign-in-pwd-phone/)

The above use cases are purposely ordered to start you off with
simplier use cases before advancing to the more complex scenarios. so you can test each one as you gradually
move on to more complex scenarios.

> **Note:** The code samples for each use case are based primarly off the
sample app provided with the SDK.
