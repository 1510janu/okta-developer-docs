title: Federated claims with entitlements
excerpt: Learn how to implement federated claims with entitlements for an app
layout: Guides
---

This guide describes how to configure your app to pass Identity Governance (IGA) entitlements to the Service Provider using federated claims. 

---

#### Learning outcomes

* Understand the purpose of federated claims with entitlements
* Understand how to configure federated claims for a SAML and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app.

#### What you need

* [Okta Developer Edition organization](https://developer.okta.com/signup)
* The Identity Governance feature enabled for your org. Contact [Okta Support](https://support.okta.com) to enable this feature.
* The Federated Claim Generation Layer feature enabled for your org. To enable this feature, go to **Settings** > **Features**, locate the Federated Claim Generation Layer feature and enable.
* An existing <SAML or OIDC> app
* A test user assigned to the <app>

## Overview

Currently, the persistence and generation of claims for tokens varies, depending on the protocol used. Only user attributes and group memberships are supported as claim types.



The experience of configuring claims for both SAML and OIDC apps should be consistent. If an expression works for OIDC, it should work exactly the same way for a SAML app. The only difference should be the output format--tailored to the requirements of SAML rather than OIDC.

A unified resolution for these inconsistencies is adding support for a new type of claim that can be consumed by all applications--federated claims generation. These claims take the form of the name of the claim and an expression (ELV3) to reference the principal information. The contexts currently available for reference are user profile attributes and appuser entitlements.

An entitlement is a permission that allows users to take specific actions within a resource, such as a third-party app. Within the Identity Provider org (Okta), app entitlements help you manage different levels of permissions that users can perform within an app. They represent permissions that you have at the Service Provider.

### Entitlements

Federated Claims with entitlements and Federated Claims with user entitlements

Entitlements are a way to represent permissions that you have in the service provider.

entitlements for the app within the IdP org is how you manage different levels of permissions that users can perform within an app.

An entitlement is a permission that allows users to take specific actions within a resource, such as an app.

There are three important properties associated with entitlements:

name: Display name for an entitlement property. this is a human-friendly name that is mutable and for display purposes only. 
externalValue: Value of an entitlement property (shown in the Admin Console as the Variable Name). Think of this property as the system/external representation of the entitlement, and that itâ€™s immutable.
parent: Representation of a resource (implicit in the Admin Console, as you can only act upon one AppInstance at a time). This is the resource that the entitlement is bound to, in this use case an AppInstance.

> Note: See the [Entitlements API](https://preview.redoc.ly/okta-iga-internal/macya-fix-ts-gen/openapi/governance.api/tag/Entitlements/#tag/Entitlements/operation/listEntitlementValues) for more information on entitlements and the supported values.

An additional attribute included with an entitlement is the value(s) that it may contain. Values contained within an entitlement may be either a single string or an array of strings. These values have two important attributes:

name: Display name of the value
externalValue: External system representation

When a user is assigned to an app that has entitlements configured, they may also be granted one or more entitlements. Each entitlement that they have been granted may have one or more values, depending on the entitlement definition (single value, multiple value, and so on). Two things need to be communcated to the downstream Service Provider (SP).

What entitlement the principal (user) has. This may be entitlement.externalValue or some other value required by the agreement between the SP and the app.
What specific values the principal (user) has for that entitlement (entitlement.values[i].externalValue)

## Update the app to use Identity Governance

Go to **Applications** > **Applications** and select the <SAML> app that you want to define entitlements for.
On the **General** tab, scroll down to the **Identity Governance** section and click **Edit**.
Select **Enabled** to enable the Governance Engine, and then click **Save**. The **Governance** tab should appear within a few seconds. If it doesn't, referesh the page.

## Define entitlements for the app

> **Note:** Entitlements that you create here are what you use in the Expression Language expressions used to ???referencing the variable name....

1. While still in the app that you updated in the previous section, select the **Governance** tab.
2. On the **Entitlements** tab, click **Add Entitlement** and define the entitlement properties:

   * Enter a **Display name** for the entitlement. In this example flow, enter **Permission**. This is an editable property and for display purposes only.
   * Enter a **Variable name** for the entitlement. In this example flow, enter **permission**. This is the external representation of the entitlement and isn't editable. Use this attribute in your Expression Language (EL) expression when you [configure the entitlement claim for your app](#configure-entitlement-claim-for-the-app).
   * Set the **Entitlement Type (Data Type)**. The entitlement can either be a static string (**String**) or a string array (**String Array**). In this example flow, select **String Array**.
   * Optional. Enter a **Description** of the entitlement.

3. Click **Next**.
4. Define entitlement attributes. You can define one value or a number of values that can then be assigned to the user. Each value must be unique:

   * Enter a **Display name** for the entitlement value. This is editable and for display purposes only. In this example flow, enter **Read**.
   * Enter a **Variable name** for the entitlement value. This is the external representation of the entitlement value and isn't editable. In this example flow, enter **Read**. This property is the name that appears in the <SAML attribute statement or token>.??
   * Optional. Enter a **Description** of the entitlement value.

5. Click **+ Add value** and repeat the previous step for the **Write** and **Delete** attribute values for this example flow.
6. Click **Save entitlement**.

## Assign entitlements to a user

> **Note:** If you created an app from scratch, assign a user to the app for testing.

1. On the **Assignments** tab, select **View access details** from the right-hand menu for your test user.
1. Click **Edit access**, and then click **Customize entitlements** to customize the entitlements for the user. The entitlement that you created in the previous section appears.
1. Select the permissions that you want to assign to the user. In this example flow, select **Read**, and then **Write**.
1. Click **Save**, and then **Save** again.

## Configure an entitlement claim for the app

1. Select the **Sign On** tab, scroll down to the **SAML Attributes** section, and click **Edit**.

   > **Note:** If you have the Identity Threat Protection (ITP) feature enabled for your org, select the **Authentication** tab.

1. Select **Add expression** to configure the user entitlement claim for the app.
1. In the **Add expression** dialog, give the entitlement claim a name.
1. In the **Expression** field, enter `appuser.entitlements.permission` as the EL expression. The `permission` attribute is the variable name that you assigned when you [defined entitlements for the app](#define-entitlements-for-the-app).
1. Click **Save**.

Test

Access the <SAML> app from the dashboard and sign in as the test user. Using "SOME SORT OF TOOL HERE", you can copy the SAML response and then use a tool such as this [SAML Tokens tool](https://samltool.io/) to view the attribute statement with the included permissions that you assigned to the test user.
