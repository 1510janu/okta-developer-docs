title: Create the token
---
To create an API token, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your Okta organization as a user with [administrator privileges](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Administrators.htm?cshid=Security_Administrators#Security_Administrators). API tokens have the same permissions as the user who creates them, and if the user permissions change, the API token permissions also change.

    If you don't have an Okta organization, you can [create one for free](https://developer.okta.com/signup).

2.  Access the API page:
    - If you use the Developer Console, select **Tokens** from the **API** menu.
    - If you use the Administrator Console (Classic UI), select **API** from the **Security** menu, and then select **Tokens**.

3.  Click **Create Token**.

4.  Name your token and click **Create Token**.

5.  Make note of your API token, as you only see it one time.
