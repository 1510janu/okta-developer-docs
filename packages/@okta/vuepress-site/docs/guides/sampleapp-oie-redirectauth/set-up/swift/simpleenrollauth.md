1. From the `okta-idx-swift` directory, open `okta-idx.xcworkspace` in XCode.
2. In the XCode title bar, set the active scheme by selecting **OktaIdxExample**, and then run the example.
3. In the simulator, enter the **Issuer URL**, **Client ID**, and **Redirect URL** that you copied in previous steps.
4. Click **Log In**, and you are redirected to the Okta Sign-In Widget.
5. Enter the **Username** and **Password** for an admin user in your Okta org, and then click **Next**. The simulator displays the access token.
    > **Note:** Which authenticators appear during sign-in depends on how your [application sign-on policy](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext-about-asop) is configured.
