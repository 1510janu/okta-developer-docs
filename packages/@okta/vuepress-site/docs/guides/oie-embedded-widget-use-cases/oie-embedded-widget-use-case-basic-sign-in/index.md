## Configuration Updates

If not already done, complete the steps that are described in [download and set up the SDK, widget, and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/). The steps guide you to the appropriate repo and location of the embedded widget sample app, identify the NuGet packages to install, and describe the additional changes that need to be made to the Okta org as required by the widget.
