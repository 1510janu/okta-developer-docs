1. Run the project from Visual Studio; the browser will load the welcome page for your new app.
2. Click on **Sign In** and you'll be redirected to Okta to complete the sign in with OIDC.
3. Once you have successfully signed in, click on **Profile** and you should see a list of user information that came along with the ID token from Okta.
