This document describes how to integrate user sign in, self-registration, and
other features into your app using Oktaâ€™s embedded SDK. Most of the code
samples in this guide are derived from the included sample application that
is provided with the SDK.

## Why you would want to use the embedded SDK

Several reasons why you would choose the embedded SDK include:

1. Customized user experience
1. Branding requirements

For a full list of reasons and a complete overview of the different deployment
models see
[Federated Authentication Vs Direct Authentication](/docs/concepts/hosted-vs-embedded/#okta-hosted-vs-customer-hosted).

## The SDK flow

The SDK integrates into your application using a native language
interface and communicates directly with the Okta APIs using a
REST interface. The flow is summarized below:
