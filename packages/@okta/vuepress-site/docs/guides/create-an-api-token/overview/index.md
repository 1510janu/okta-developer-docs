API tokens are used to authenticate requests to the Okta APIs. API tokens inherit the API access of the user who creates them, so we recommend that you create a [service account user](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Administrators.htm?cshid=Security_Administrators#Security_Administrators) with only the permission levels that you need for the token to perform the API tasks that you require.
