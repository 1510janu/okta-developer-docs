# APIs only documented on the new Beta reference

Weâ€™ve got a new API reference in the works. With a fresh look and feel, our new API content will be easier to navigate and contribute to. This reference is in BETA and content is continuously being added. [Try it out](https://preview.redoc.ly/oktadev/rchan-content-import-d5936630/) and help us improve the site by [providing feedback](#).

In some cases, APIs have only been documented on the new Beta reference site, and not on the old API reference that you are currently looking at. This page provides a list of those, so they can be found more easily.
