## About the Sign-In Widget (third generation)

The Sign-In Widget enables registration, enrollment, verification, and recovery experiences for your users. It's where everyone in your org starts their Okta session.

The third generation of the Sign-In Widget offers the same user experience as the second generation, and adds accessibility improvements in color contrast, focus management, and screen reader behavior.

See [Style the sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/) for details about customizing the second generation widget.


## Upgrade to the third generation

To upgrade to the third generation:

1. In the **Admin Console**, go to **Customizations** > **Brands**.
1. Select a brand.
1. Go to the **Pages** tab, and then click **Edit** or **Configure** for the **Sign-in page**.
1. Click the **Settings** tab.
1. In the **Sign-In Widget version** section, click **Edit**.
1. To use the third-generation, click the **Use the third generation** toggle so that it's active. Leave the toggle inactive to remain on the second generation.
1. Click **Save to draft**.

See [Style the sign-in page](/docs/guides/custom-widget/main/) for details about customizing the second generation.

## Use the code editor

<!-- repeating this content from the other guide... want to have a fresh start on the 3rd gen page. i'll probably tweak it to focus on the JS API -->

Use the code editor to add design tokens to your code. Design tokens call the JS API.

> **Note:** You can only enable the code editor if you configure a [custom domain](/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/).

See [Customization examples](#customization-examples) for snippets that you can update and use.

1. In the Admin Console, go to **Customizations** > **Brands**, and then select the brand you want.
2. In the **Pages** tab, click **Configure** in the **Sign-in page** panel.
3. To open the code editor, turn on the toggle next to **Code editor**.
4. Make changes directly in the editor. If you enter `{`, `(`, or `.` you see a list of available variables that you can use. See [Use variables](#use-variables).
   * Click **Save to draft**, then **Preview**, **Revert**, or **Publish**.
   * Select **Compare with published version** to see the difference between your edited version and the published version. You can choose between a split view and a unified view.

   > **Note:** To discard your changes without publishing them, click **Revert changes** or turn off the toggle next to **Code editor**. Turning off the code editor restores the default HTML/CSS and JavaScript code.

See [Customization examples](#customization-examples) for ways to use design tokens with the third generation widget.


## Use design tokens

From "Color":

Tokens make Odysseyâ€™s visual style consistent and easier to update. Tokens replace static values to assign color.

From "Typography":

Design tokens replace hardcoded visual style values, making it faster and easier to build and update designs. Tokens allow typography to be understood and used consistently across design and code.

Typography choices such as font, line height, size, tracking, and weight can be implemented using tokens.

## Test your customizations

<!-- Lester: do you think we can add any quick tips here? or is it a visual, trial and error type thing done in the console? -->
