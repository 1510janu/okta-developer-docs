Okta has updated the process by which an ISV publishes their integration into the Okta Integration Network (OIN).

When you are ready, use [the OIN Manager](https://oinmanager.okta.com/) tool to submit for Okta review.

In order for an app to be published in the Okta Integration Network, you'll need the following:

* An ISV configuration guide explaining:
  * The supported features
  * Step-by-step instructions for setting up the integration
  * Gotchas & known issues
  * Support and Contact Info
* ISV Support Contact
* ISV Escalation Contact
* Full, permanent test tenant provided to Okta
* RunScope Test Suite results

Once Okta completes the internal QA process and all requested changes are made, Okta publishes the app as Okta-Verified to the Okta Integration Network.
