## Order of the configuration options

When multiple configurations are used simultaneously, the sample app selects the configuration based on the following order:

1. [Directly in code](TBD)
1. [Environment variables](TBD)
1. [External configuration file](TBD)

> **Note:** Use only one configuration option in your solution to avoid confusion with setting overrides.
