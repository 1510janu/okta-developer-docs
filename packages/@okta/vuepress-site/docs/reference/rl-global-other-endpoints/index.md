### All other endpoints

Finally, for all endpoints not listed in the categories above, the API rate limit is a combined rate limit:

| Developer (free) | Developer (paid) | One App    | Enterprise | Workforce Identity |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1000             | 3000             | 3000       | 6000       | 10000              |

> **Note:** For organizations created before 2018-05-17, the limit is 10,000 requests per minute. See [Legacy rate limits](/docs/reference/legacy-rl/) to learn more.
