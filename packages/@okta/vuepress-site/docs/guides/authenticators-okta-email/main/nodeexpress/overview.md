With the Embedded SDK, your app can verify a user's identity using the email authenticator. You can integrate the email enrollment and challenge and complete those flows using magic links and OTP. Use this guide to learn how.

### Discover the convenience of magic links

A user performs one action with magic links - a click on a link - to complete the email verification. The experience is less choppy than OTP, where a user must switch between their email and your app to find and submit the OTP. Because of this, magic links is a balance of security and convenience and provides a frictionless experience for your users.
